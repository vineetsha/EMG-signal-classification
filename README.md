# EMG-signal-classification using DNN
A detailed empirical exploration on Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classification system for the upper limb position invariant myoelectric signal is performed. The classification of eight different hand movements is performed using a fully connected feed-forward DNN model . A dataset consisting of the sEMG signals collected from eleven subjects at five different upper limb positions is used . EMG classification problem is absolutely subject specific. Hence, the parameters of each DNN has been optimized for a specific subject.
The subject is not considered as a dimension of generalization rather it aim is to achieve trained generalized model regarding various limb positions.
The dataset used consist of myoelectricsignal obtained from the upper limb of different subjects using seven electrode channels at five different limb positions, which were recorded by Rami Khushaba which is available at https://www.rami-khushaba.com/electromyogram-emg-repository.html
The eight different classes of hand movements considered are wrist extension(1), wrist flexion(2),wrist pronation(3), wrist supination(4), openhand(5), rest(6), power grip(7) and pinch grip(8).
