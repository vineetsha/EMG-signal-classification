fTDD is a feature extraction algorithm for the classification of any kind of signals, although this was mainly developed for myoelectric signal feature extraction for prostheses control.
Fused time domain descriptors (fTDD) are the features which combine the essential information between the current window(nth) and the previous window ((n − step)th), in which step = 1, 2,. . .,N, determines the separation between the current and previous windows.
The advantage of this scheme is that if the two windows occur during the same class, it will enhance the correlation between the fused features, whereas for non-similar classes the correlation will be diminished.
A set of six features were obtained per channel, implying a total of 42 (6 features × 7 channels) feature components representing each data sample which is formed by concatenation of features from all the channels present.
